CHALLENGE

Using the JavaScript language, have the function LongestWord(sen) take the sen 
parameter being passed and return the largest word in the string. If there are 
two or more words that are the same length, return the first word from the 
string with that length. Ignore punctuation and assume sen will not be empty. 

***********************

SOLUTION

1. Split string into an array and replace punctuation with a blank
2. Sort the array by descending order of length
3. Shift the first word of the array for the solution

************************

function LongestWord(sen) {
  //The ^ symbol in the regex will look for any character not in the designated group which is how we identify the punctuation
  var newArray = sen.replace(/[^a-zA-Z]/g, "")split(" ");
  newArray.sort(zero, one) { return one.length - zero.length; }
  return newArray.shift();
  
  }
  
}
